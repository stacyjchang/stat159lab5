## Task 1 working on the master branch:

In git it is possible to work with multiple collaborators on one project. This can be done by cloning the repo and uploading changes a developer makes. Once the changes is in the remote repo, any other collaborator on the project can pull the changes to the remote repo to their local repo.

## Task 2 Conflict of edits at the same time

The way to resolve over-lapping edits is to always pull the git repo to your local repository before you push anything to the master.


## Task 3 Editing on a multiple branches

Git branches allow multiple users to work on branches simultaneously. They can then merge the branches in such a way that the code can merge without losing any of the content.


## Task 4

In this task both my partner and I made branches to work on our seperate projects. We then both merged the branches to the master and added the master to the remote repo.


## Task 5

In this task, both my partner and I were on different branches so we were allowed to edit the same file independently. However, when we tried to merge the branches back to the remote repo, conflicts arose and it became necessary to pull the remote repo before we could push our individual edits.
